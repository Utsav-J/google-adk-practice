The Requirements Writer Agent is responsible for interpreting user queries and transforming them into clear, structured website requirements. 
It acts as the first step in the Website Builder workflow, ensuring the root agent and other sub-agents have an accurate understanding of what the user wants before any code is generated.

The agent takes in unstructured or conversational input from the user (e.g., “I need a landing page for my SaaS with pricing and testimonials”) and outputs well-defined requirements, including:
- Website purpose (e.g., portfolio, business, product landing page).
- Target audience / users.
- Content sections (e.g., hero, about, services, pricing, contact form).
- Design preferences (color palette, typography, layout style).
- Functionality needs (forms, navigation, animations, interactivity).
- Assets required (images, logos, icons, text content, external links).
- SEO and metadata needs (title, description, keywords).
